    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I was born and raised in South Brunswick, New Jersey, and moved to Charlotte, North Carolina, at the age of 15. In my free time, I enjoy playing poker, going to the gym, reading, and trading.</li>
        <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> I got my first internship during my Freshman summer at Spectrum (Charter Communications) as a Finance Intern, where I was given a return offer to intern throughout my sophomore year. Then during my sophomore year, I interned at two startups simultaneously, raising over $10,000,000 across 2 funding rounds with 2 investment bankers who are mentors of mine. Following that, I interned at Brookfield Properties virtually my first semester of my Junior year as a Commercial Real Estate Intern. After that experience, I interned at KCSA Strategic Communications as a Capital Markets Intern. In this role, I was reaching out to Hedge Funds, Venture Capitalists, and other investors with presentations and Offering Memorandums I had created, with the ultimate goal of them pouring significant investment into 2 publicly traded companies I was working with. Then, my Junior summer was spent on Wall Street. I interned on the Trading Floor at Wells Fargo as a Sales & Trading Summer Analyst where I was working over 90 hours a week, pitching bonds and trade ideas to everyone on the floor and some of our institutional investors such as Blackrock, and Vanguard just to name a few. I was fortunate enough to receive a return offer and will be returning to the trading floor on the Secured Funding desk as a Trader. Fun fact, I got deferred from UNC Charlotte.</li>
        <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I'm a Senior majoring in Finance with a minor in Economics. Iam graduating in May of 2025, this semester</li>
        <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> I use both Mac and Windows</li>

            </ul>
        <li><strong>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by:</strong> I was born with a condition called Strabismus, also known as cross-eyes. I've had multiple surgeries and my eyes are now normal!</li>
        <li><strong>I’d also like to Share:</strong> I love playing Poker, and the best hand I've ever had is a straight flush! I still am yet to get a Royal Flush</li>
